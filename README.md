Rebuild the classic game of Breakout with camera shake, sound effects, powerups, and trailing paths in Godot.

## Context
I took a course in Game Design, and we were tasked to rebuild Breakout using the Godot game engine and GDscript language. It was a fun little project that provided me some experience with game design. The game isn't very complex, and there is only one level.
